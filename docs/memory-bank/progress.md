# Progress

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Hexagonal architecture implementation with clear separation of domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- ✅ Dependency injection using Uber's fx library
- ✅ HTTP server setup with appropriate routing
- ✅ Error handling framework

### External Integrations
- ✅ Slack API integration for receiving events and sending messages
- ✅ GitHub API integration for file management and PR creation
- ✅ Vertex AI integration for LLM capabilities
- ✅ RAG Engine API integration for document retrieval

### Agent Capabilities
- ✅ Tool-based agent implementation with XML parsing
- ✅ Document generation from conversations
- ✅ Question answering with source citations
- ✅ File management in GitHub repositories

### Workflows
- ✅ Conversation management with history tracking
- ✅ Document proposal creation and refinement
- ✅ RAG-based question answering

## What's Left to Build

### User Experience Improvements
- ⬜ Enhanced citation UI with clickable links to source documents (in progress)
- ⬜ Improved error messages and recovery mechanisms
- ⬜ Progress indicators for long-running operations

### Feature Enhancements
- ⬜ Support for more document formats and structures
- ⬜ Enhanced document organization capabilities
- ⬜ Improved context management for more accurate responses
- ⬜ Advanced conversation history analysis

### Technical Improvements
- ✅ Refactor AttemptCompleteHandler to move Slack-specific logic to infrastructure layer
- ⬜ Migration of RAG corpus to use GitHub permalinks as displayName
- ⬜ Comprehensive test coverage
- ⬜ Performance optimizations for RAG queries
- ⬜ Enhanced monitoring and logging
- ⬜ Improved error handling and recovery

## Current Status

The project is in MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage with core functionality implemented. Recent development has focused on enhancing the citation system to show sources of information when answering questions, improving the agent's autonomy in determining its workflow, and refactoring the architecture to better adhere to clean architecture principles.

The system can currently:
1. Monitor Slack conversations
2. Generate documentation based on conversations
3. Create pull requests in GitHub for document changes
4. Answer questions based on existing documentation with source citations (currently showing file paths)
5. Manage conversation flow and history

The team is currently implementing the user story "Enable verification of citation sources in question responses," which will allow users to directly access source documents via GitHub permalinks rather than just seeing file paths.

## Known Issues

1. **Source URI Formatting**: The current URI format for sources is not directly usable as URLs and needs to be improved. RAG corpus entries use file paths as displayName, which doesn't allow direct access to the source documents.

2. **Context Management**: There may be limitations in how much context the agent can effectively manage, potentially affecting the quality of generated documentation or answers.

3. **Integration Edge Cases**: There may be edge cases in the interactions between Slack, GitHub, and Vertex AI that haven't been fully addressed.

4. **Error Recovery**: While basic error handling is in place, more sophisticated recovery mechanisms may be needed for production use.
