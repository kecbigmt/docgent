## Project Name
Docgent

## Core Concept
Docgent is an AI agent that bridges the gap between real-time communication and formal documentation, ensuring valuable knowledge is systematically captured, organized, and made accessible to everyone.

## Mission Statement
To transform ephemeral Slack conversations into structured, maintainable documentation while providing intelligent question-answering capabilities based on the organization's knowledge base.

## Core Requirements

1. **Automated Documentation Generation**
   - Monitor conversations for valuable information
   - Generate structured documentation from these conversations
   - Create proposals for review and collaboration

2. **Collaborative Refinement**
   - Enable feedback and improvements through a review interface
   - Incorporate user feedback to refine generated documentation
   - Maintain version control and history of documentation changes

3. **Intelligent Question Answering**
   - Provide accurate answers to questions based on existing documentation
   - Cite sources transparently to build trust and enable verification
   - Maintain conversation context for natural interactions

4. **Seamless Integration**
   - Integrate with existing communication and documentation workflows
   - Minimize disruption to team processes
   - Operate without requiring custom databases or interfaces

## Success Criteria

1. **Knowledge Accessibility**: Team members can quickly find authoritative information
2. **Reduced Repetition**: Decrease in repetitive questions and explanations
3. **Documentation Currency**: Documentation remains up-to-date with actual practices
4. **Knowledge Democratization**: Reduced dependency on specific individuals for information
5. **Efficiency**: Measurable time savings in documentation and knowledge sharing

## Constraints

1. **MVP Approach**: Focus on core functionality without custom UIs or databases
2. **Current Implementation**: For MVP, utilizing Slack for communication and GitHub for documentation
3. **Privacy Considerations**: Handle sensitive information appropriately
4. **Performance Requirements**: Maintain responsive interactions despite API dependencies

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

1. Custom web interface
2. Direct integration with other chat platforms besides Slack
3. Advanced document formatting beyond what's supported by Markdown
4. Automated documentation without human review
