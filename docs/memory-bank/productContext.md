# Product Context

## Why Docgent Exists

Docgent exists to solve a critical problem in engineering organizations: the disconnect between real-time communication and formal documentation. In modern engineering teams, valuable knowledge is constantly being shared in Slack conversations, but this information often remains trapped in chat history rather than being captured in formal documentation.

This leads to several problems:
- Knowledge becomes siloed and dependent on specific individuals
- New team members struggle to find authoritative information
- The same questions get asked and answered repeatedly
- Documentation becomes outdated or inconsistent with actual practices

Docgent bridges this gap by automatically generating and updating documentation based on Slack conversations, ensuring that knowledge is systematically captured, organized, and made accessible to everyone.

## Problems Docgent Solves

1. **Knowledge Silos**: By capturing knowledge from conversations and transforming it into documentation, Docgent reduces dependency on specific individuals who hold critical information.

2. **Documentation Maintenance**: Docgent automates the tedious process of creating and updating documentation, which is often neglected due to time constraints.

3. **Information Consistency**: By centralizing documentation in GitHub repositories, Docgent ensures there's a single source of truth for organizational knowledge.

4. **Repetitive Questions**: With up-to-date documentation and a question-answering capability, Docgent reduces the need for engineers to repeatedly answer the same questions.

5. **Onboarding Friction**: New team members can quickly get up to speed by accessing comprehensive, current documentation rather than having to piece together information from various sources.

## How Docgent Works

1. **Conversation Monitoring**: Docgent monitors Slack channels for conversations that contain valuable information worth documenting.

2. **Document Generation**: When triggered (either automatically or by user request), Docgent analyzes the conversation and generates appropriate documentation.

3. **GitHub Integration**: Docgent creates a pull request in the designated GitHub repository with the proposed documentation changes.

4. **Collaborative Refinement**: Team members can review, comment on, and suggest changes to the documentation through GitHub's PR interface.

5. **RAG-Powered Q&A**: Once documentation is merged, it's indexed in a RAG corpus, enabling Docgent to answer questions based on the documented knowledge.

6. **Continuous Improvement**: As new information emerges in conversations, Docgent can update existing documentation to keep it current.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Minimal Disruption**: Docgent integrates seamlessly with existing workflows in Slack and GitHub, requiring minimal changes to how teams already work.

2. **Transparent Operation**: Users should understand what Docgent is doing and why, with clear indications of when it's generating documentation and how it's using conversation data.

3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: While Docgent automates documentation generation, humans maintain control through the PR review process, ensuring accuracy and appropriateness.

4. **Accessible Knowledge**: Documentation should be easy to find and navigate, with the Q&A capability providing a natural language interface to the knowledge base.

5. **Adaptive Learning**: Docgent should improve over time based on user feedback and interaction patterns, becoming more accurate and helpful with use.

## Success Metrics

1. **Documentation Coverage**: Increase in the percentage of important topics that are documented.

2. **Documentation Freshness**: Reduction in the average age of documentation and frequency of updates.

3. **Question Reduction**: Decrease in repetitive questions asked in Slack channels.

4. **Time Savings**: Reduction in time spent manually creating and updating documentation.

5. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from users about the quality and usefulness of Docgent-generated documentation.
