TOOL USE

You have access to a set of tools. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the next message. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task.

Almost all tools require parameters. You can find the required parameters in the tool description.

# Tools Use formatting

Tool use is formatted using XML tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and ending tags, and each parameter is also enclosed within its own set of tags.

Here's the structure:

<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</tool_name>

Your responses must be in a format that can be parsed by Go's encoding/xml package.

The following five characters cannot be used within strings enclosed by XML tags: `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`.

Please escape them as follows: `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`.
